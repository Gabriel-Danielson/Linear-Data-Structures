# Linear-Data-Structures

1. Write a few sentences describing when you would use a linked list in solving a problem and why you would do so.
Linked lists are helpful for when you are expecting to need to change the data within the list frequently. They should be used for anything that doesn't require sorting or lists that are expected to change sizes.
Some examples of their use would be for history tracking, such as withundo/redo functions or GPS directions. 

2. Write a sentence or two describing the difference between a stack and a queue.
Stacks and queues are very similar, but with one distinct difference.
They are both data types that can hold lists of items, but stacks work Last in, first out, while queues work first in, first out.
Meaning that, the most recent item in a stack will be called first, while in a queue it's the oldest item called first.

3. Describe a situation in which a developer would use a stack while writing a program.
A stack can be used when a developer needs to evaluate certain mathematical expressions.
When expressions are in "in-fix notation", a stack can be used to convert it to "post-fix notation".
From there, the expression can also be evaluated using a stack.

4. In what situation would a developer use an array rather than a list while writing a program?
A developer would use an array over a list when the data needs to be retrieved quickly and efficiently.
Lists are used most often, but an array may be used instead for the sake of performance.
